# RO2ERL Hub

A central message router for the Target-X system, managing communication between distributed ROS2/DDS networks through ro2erl bridges.

## Overview

ro2erl_hub is a central component in the Target-X system that facilitates message routing between distributed ROS2 networks. It works in conjunction with ro2erl_bridge components to enable secure and reliable communication between ROS2 nodes across different sites.

For detailed design information, see:
- [Hub Design Documentation](doc/design.md)
- [RO2ERL Documentation](https://github.com/stritzinger/ro2erl_doc)

## Requirements

- Erlang/OTP 27 or later
- rebar3

## Development

### Without TLS Distribution

Start an interactive shell with debug logging and a specific node name:

```bash
rebar3 shell --sname hub@localhost --setcookie targetx
```

### With TLS Distribution

To start a local development shell with support for TLS distribution, you need
first to generate a testing CA and certificate:

```bash
local/setup.sh
```

Then you can start the shell with:

```bash
ERL_FLAGS='-proto_dist inet_tls -ssl_dist_optfile local/ssl_dist_opts.rel -connect_all false' rebar3 as local shell --sname hub --setcookie targetx
```

The hub node will be started with the short name `hub` and the cookie `targetx`.
This allows other nodes (like bridges) to connect to it during development,
and it should support GRiSP board using its secure element.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment on grisp.io:

```bash
# Build the release with production dependencies
rebar3 as prod release

# Build the Docker image for deployment
rebar3 as prod docker

# Push the image to your registry
docker push local/ro2erl_hub:0.1.0 your-registry/ro2erl_hub:0.1.0
```

The production build includes the braidnode dependency which is required for deployment on grisp.io. This dependency is not included in the development environment to simplify local testing.

# Run tests

```bash
rebar3 ct
```
